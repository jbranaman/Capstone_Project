# World Happiness - Capstone Project

## PRESENTATION <br>
###### <i>S1 - SELECTED TOPIC</i>
Our selected topic is analyzing data from the World Happiness Report. We will specifically be comparing 2015 and 2016 and then use machine learning to make predictions about 2022. We believe it will be interesting to analyze this data using variables like region, economy, and life expectancy. 


###### <i>S1 - REASONS WHY THEY SELECTED THEIR TOPIC</i>
The reason why we selected this topic was to get a better understanding on the different regions in the world that people ranked that were the happiest and to see the factors that contributed to their rankings. Using that information, it would be interesting to predict for this current year, 2022, where in the world would people rank would be the happiest.



###### <i>S1 - DESCRIPTION OF THEIR SOURCE OF DATA</i>
We downloaded our dataset from Kaggle, originially from the World Happiness Report. 



###### <i>S1 - QUESTIONS THEY HOPE TO ANSWER WITH THE DATA</i>
1. What will be the top 5 regions in the world that will be ranked the happiest in 2022?
2. What is the average family income for the top 5 regions ranked the happiest?
3. What is the life-span of those who live in the regions ranked the 5 least happiest?



###### <i>S2 - DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA EXPLORATION PHASE OF THE PROJECT</i>
**Big Picture Question:** What region in the world will be the happiest place to live?
